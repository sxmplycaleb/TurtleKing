# Turtle King

Turtle King is a pass-and-play card game for friends, built with Flutter for
Android and iOS.


## Milestone 01 — Project Foundation

This milestone establishes the project skeleton: a minimal Flutter app that
runs on Android and iOS with a branded home screen. Gameplay (cards, rounds,
YAMADA mechanics, multiplayer, etc.) is intentionally **not** implemented yet.

## Milestone 02 — Player Setup

This milestone lets players configure a game before it begins:

- **Player model** — each player has a unique id, a name, and a color.
- **Player setup screen** — reached from the home screen's New Game button.
  Add players by name, remove them, and see the live player count.
- **Validation** — empty and duplicate names are rejected with inline
  feedback; names are trimmed on entry.
- **Limits** — 2 to 10 players. Start Game stays disabled until at least 2
  players are added, and adding stops at 10.
- **Auto colors** — each player is automatically assigned a distinct color
  from a fixed 10-color palette; removing a player frees their color.
- **Start Game** — hands the configured players to a placeholder game screen
  ("Game ready", player count, and names) with a temporary way back to setup.

Cards, rounds, and actual gameplay arrive in later milestones.

## Milestone 03 — Standard Deck & Card System

This milestone adds the reusable card foundation for later gameplay:

- **Standard 52-card deck** — four suits (Hearts, Diamonds, Clubs, Spades) and
  thirteen ranks (Ace, 2–10, Jack, Queen, King), with exactly one card for
  every suit/rank combination.
- **Rank values** — Ace is lowest (1), King is highest (13); numeric cards use
  their face value, Jack = 11, Queen = 12.
- **Card model** — immutable `Card` with suit, rank, a numeric value derived
  from the rank, and a display name like "Ace of Hearts". Cards compare by
  value equality.
- **Deck operations** — `shuffle()`, `dealOne()`, `deal(count)`,
  `remainingCards`, and `reset()`. Dealing from an empty (or too-small) deck
  throws `EmptyDeckException`.
- **Out of scope** — no gameplay, player hands, dealing to players, YAMADA,
  cup mechanics, round escalation, elimination, or multiplayer. Those arrive
  in later milestones.
