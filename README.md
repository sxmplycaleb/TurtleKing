# Turtle King

Turtle King is a pass-and-play card game for friends, built with Flutter for
Android and iOS.


## Milestone 01 — Project Foundation

This milestone establishes the project skeleton: a minimal Flutter app that
runs on Android and iOS with a branded home screen. Gameplay (cards, rounds,
YAMADA mechanics, multiplayer, etc.) is intentionally **not** implemented yet.

## Prerequisites

- Flutter SDK (stable channel) — see https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install
- For Android: Android SDK (via Android Studio)
- For iOS: Xcode (macOS only)

## Setup

```sh
flutter pub get
```

## Run

```sh
# Run on a connected device or emulator
flutter run

# Pick a specific device
flutter devices
flutter run -d <device-id>
```

## Tests

```sh
flutter test
```

## Static analysis

```sh
flutter analyze
```

## Build

```sh
# Android
flutter build apk --debug
flutter build apk --release

# iOS (requires macOS with Xcode)
flutter build ios
```

## Project structure

```

  main.dart          # App entry point
  theme.dart         # Shared visual theme
